# Changelog

A release is a push to `main` that changes `VERSION` to a version with no tag yet. CI then makes the
release build, tags the commit `vX.Y.Z` and publishes the GitHub Release with that version's notes,
taken from its section below. Add the section in the same pull request as the `VERSION` change.

## 0.5.1

- **The wah is now heard.** Covering the sound hole (ENV → Body: Wah, the mod wheel, pressure, the Hole
  key, or Wah rate) muffles the sound like a vowel closing: bright with the hole open, dark and a little
  quieter covered, with a vowel-like peak sweeping through the tines on the way. Before, it only moved a
  resonance below the lowest tine, and barely changed the sound. Box and Gourd have a hole; Board and
  None don't.
- The hand glides over the hole in about 20 ms, so the Hole key covers and uncovers it without a click.
- **Wah is how much wah.** With Wah rate on, the hand flutters from open to Wah and back, so Wah 100 is
  the full sweep. It was the other way round: the flutter filled what Wah left open, so Wah 100 didn't
  move at all.
- **Wah rate**'s lowest setting reads **Off** (it was "Hand"): the hand stays where Wah puts it.

## 0.5.0

- **Theme**, a new knob on the Setup page (GLO, KNOB 4): **Light**, the pale wood and dark ink as
  before, or **Dark**, near-black with cream and amber. In Dark the knob bars and the chips turn cream
  and brown, so amber only means a tine sounding or a knob touched. The tines keep their metal in both.
  The screen changes at once, and the theme is saved with your settings.
- The Setup page's header shows the firmware's version, beside the CPU load.
- Saved settings carry over; Theme starts on Light.

## 0.4.1

- **Tine is now left-first**, as on a 17-key kalimba in C. C4 sits on white key 9, the next note up
  (D4) is on its left, and the scale alternates outward: D6 on the far left, C6 on the far right
  ([#1](https://github.com/jadamsowers/fm1-fimba/issues/1)).
- **Mirror**, a new Layout value (Keys page, KNOB 1), keeps the old right-first arrangement: C4 on
  key 8, D4 on its right.
- Saved settings carry over. A project saved on Tine plays the new way; pick Mirror for the old one.

## 0.4.0

- **16 voices** (up from 12): fewer tines cut short when long-ringing steel tines and patterns overlap.
  Upper overtones that have died away are skipped, so ordinary playing costs less.
- **Worn**: an old, played-in kalimba. Each tine gets its own quirks: a little out of tune (up to ±12
  cents), a longer or shorter sustain, a faster or slower beat, uneven brightness and level.
- **Pages by button**: each page button owns its pages; press it again for the next (dots in the
  header show which). HOME: Tine → **Character** (Worn, Glide, Tuning, Release). ENV: Body.
  FX: Space → Color. LFO: Grain → Spread. SEL: Keys → Play. SEQ: Pattern. GLO: Setup.
- **ARP**: tap to start or stop the pattern; **hold** to open its settings.
- Settings saved by earlier versions carry over; new settings start at their defaults.

## 0.3.0

- The web page installs FiMba-1 on the FM-1 over USB, and offers the highest release.
- It runs on the FM-1: the first install on real hardware boots and plays.

## 0.2.0

- CI builds the firmware package and checks it against FoMni's; a version tag makes a release.

## 0.1.0

- The first release.
